            <h1>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering (FCE)</h1>
            <p>The <strong>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</strong> is a cornerstone subject in the Computer Engineering degree. It introduces students to the basic concepts and tools necessary for understanding and building modern computing systems. This course serves as the foundation for more advanced topics in both hardware and software engineering.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Topics Covered</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Computer Architecture:</strong> Understanding how a computer works internally, including the CPU, memory, and storage systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming Basics:</strong> Learning foundational programming concepts such as variables, loops, and functions to solve real-world problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Systems:</strong> Introduction to binary numbers, logic gates, and how circuits process data at a fundamental level.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Foundations:</strong> Applying discrete mathematics and linear algebra to computer engineering problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Understanding the software development lifecycle and writing simple, structured programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The course is designed to provide students with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clear understanding of the basic building blocks of computing systems.</li>
                <li>The ability to analyze and solve problems using programming and logical thinking.</li>
                <li>The knowledge required to design and develop small-scale digital and software systems.</li>
                <li>The skills to connect theoretical concepts with practical applications in computing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Relevance in the Degree</h2>
            <p>FCE lays the groundwork for many advanced topics in Computer Engineering, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating Systems</li>
                <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Cybersecurity</li>
                <li>Networking and Distributed Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without a solid understanding of the fundamentals, students would find it challenging to tackle the more complex subjects and technologies in their academic and professional careers.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>The skills and concepts learned in FCE are not only essential for succeeding in your degree, but also for a wide range of careers in technology. From software engineering to cybersecurity, the knowledge gained from this subject is indispensable in solving real-world challenges and building innovative solutions.</p>
